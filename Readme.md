## Factorio Server Docker

Run a headless Factorio server in Docker

This project broke from working to get Factorio to build and deploy in a OpenShift/OKD cluster. The first version was a very hacked together collection of scripts. 

This version replaces it with a series of configuration and better practices for mods and settings.
